description: "Manifest V3 extension used to sync WhatsApp contacts and workflows into DealDash."

Implementation root: `/whatsapp-extension-react`.

## Responsibilities

- capture contact/chat context from WhatsApp Web
- sync selected data into DealDash backend
- support auth-aware interactions with DealDash APIs

## High-Risk Areas

- auth token propagation and refresh behavior
- permissions declared in `public/manifest.json`
- message/contact parsing assumptions from WhatsApp DOM

## Change Workflow

```bash
cd /whatsapp-extension-react
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

## Validation

- extension builds without errors
- auth flow works with target backend
- contact sync does not duplicate or corrupt records
- permission set remains minimal
