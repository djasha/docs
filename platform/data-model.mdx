## Core Entity Groups

- identity: `users`
- delivery: `deals`, `influencers`, `contacts`
- execution: `tasks`, `reminders`, `notifications`
- collaboration: `team_*` tables, shares, user assignments
- media/links: `screenshots`, `short_links`

## Source of Truth

- canonical schema: `/server/db/schema.ts`
- migrations: `/migrations`

## Schema Change Rules

1. migration-first updates
2. update route validation and types in same change
3. run integration tests for impacted flows
4. update docs when entity or enum semantics change

## Drift Prevention

Do not rely on docs-only enums for automation decisions. Validate against schema definitions and route validation logic.
