title: "AI Governance Review (2026-02-19)"
description: "Cross-system review of AI readiness, advisor findings, and governance status."
---

## Scope

- repository health checks
- Supabase advisor-oriented findings
- Render deployment advisor-oriented findings
- GitHub issue visibility

## Results

- `pnpm check`: pass
- `pnpm docs:check`: pass
- `pnpm format:check`: pass (after formatting sync)
- open GitHub issues:
  - `djasha/DealDash`: 0
  - `djasha/docs`: 0

## Workflow Findings

- recent CI failures were traced to:
  - transient npm audit endpoint 500s
  - formatting check drift
  - docs-sync token-gate behavior
- remediations:
  - retry-aware audit script
  - formatting normalization
  - docs-sync safe-skip when token is absent

## Problems To Track

- AI schema drift risk
- high `any` density in backend critical paths
- test warning noise

## Remediation Applied

- added Supabase advisor fix migration (`2026-02-19`)
- hardened `render.yaml` build determinism + health checks
- expanded categorized problem catalog + template

## Next Iteration

1. automate AI schema-to-runtime consistency checks
2. reduce `any` in highest-risk route modules
3. add weekly governance workflow reporting
