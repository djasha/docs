DealDash is a multi-surface system with shared data and permission boundaries.

## Components

1. React web app (`/client`)
2. Express API (`/server`)
3. Supabase/Postgres data and auth
4. WhatsApp MV3 extension (`/whatsapp-extension-react`)
5. LinkShot MV3 extension (`/linkshot-extension`)

## Core Product Domains

- deal lifecycle and influencer tracking
- contacts, notes, reminders, tasks
- messaging templates and workflows
- collaboration (teams/users/shares)
- screenshots and short links

## Runtime Endpoints (local defaults)

- web app: Vite dev server (`http://localhost:5173` unless overridden)
- API: `http://localhost:3333`
- health: `http://localhost:3333/api/health`

## Operating Principle

All behavior changes should include code updates, test validation, and docs updates in the same change set.
