title: "Architecture: System Overview"
description: "High-level architecture of DealDash across web, API, extensions, and data flows."
---

DealDash is a multi-surface product with a shared data model and role-based operations.

## Core Surfaces

1. Web app (`/client`, React + Vite)
2. API server (`/server`, Express + Drizzle)
3. WhatsApp extension (`/whatsapp-extension-react`, Manifest V3)
4. LinkShot extension (`/linkshot-extension`, Manifest V3 + OCR/offscreen)

## Core Domains

- authentication and user identity
- deals and influencer tracking
- contacts, notes, reminders, tasks
- templates and messaging workflows
- screenshots, short links, external sharing
- teams and collaboration

## Runtime Composition

- API routes mounted in `/server/index.ts`
- schema and migrations owned by `/server/db/schema.ts` and `/migrations`
- shared types/helpers in `/shared`
- route-level risk concentrated in auth/public/share endpoints

## Design Constraints for AI Agents

- prefer small, additive changes
- preserve backward compatibility unless planned migration exists
- update docs in the same change as behavior updates
- include verification evidence in every handoff
