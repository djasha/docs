title: "Deals Routes"
description: "Deals CRUD and progress tracking endpoints."

Implemented in `/server/routes/deals.ts`:

- Deals CRUD: `GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/deals/*`
- Bulk operations: `/bulk-delete`, `/bulk-update`, `/bulk-import/*`
- Progress children: videos, stories, views, payments
- Utilities: `/due-views`, `/find-by-url`, `/related-users`

## Change guidance

When updating this route group:

1. run integration tests (`tests/integration/deals-api.test.ts`)
2. re-check related short-link and screenshot integrations
