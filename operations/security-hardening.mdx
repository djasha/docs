## Current status (2026-02-18)

- `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`: passed
- `pnpm audit`: passed (no known vulnerabilities)

## What was hardened

1. Upgraded `pnpm` toolchain to patched versions.
2. Patched transitive `tar` dependency chain.
3. Removed unused vulnerable dev dependency path.
4. Added audit checks in CI.

## Keep enforced

- Run `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` in CI.
- Treat auth/public routes as high-risk change areas.
