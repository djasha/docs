Support agents deliver scoped implementation safely and quickly.

## Execution Contract

1. restate scope in one paragraph
2. implement smallest safe change
3. run required checks
4. update docs in the same task
5. report residual risk clearly

## Required Task Output

- behavior implemented
- files changed
- command results
- remaining risk
- recommended next action

## Safe Defaults

- prefer additive edits over broad rewrites
- avoid mixing feature + refactor + schema changes in one patch
- use explicit types and validation boundaries
- isolate extension changes per extension folder
