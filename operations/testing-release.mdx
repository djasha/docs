## Baseline Test Matrix

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm docs:check
```

Add as required:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
```

## Release Checklist

1. pull latest `main`
2. run full validation for touched scope
3. verify docs updates are included
4. verify no secrets/config leakage
5. verify rollback path is documented

## Noise Debt

Non-failing warnings (for example React `act(...)` warnings) should be reduced over time to keep CI signal clean for agent-driven execution.
