## Daily Command Set

```bash
pnpm dev:full
pnpm check
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm docs:check
```

Add `pnpm test:e2e` for auth/public/UI-routing changes.

## Required Merge Gates

1. typecheck passes
2. relevant tests pass
3. docs updated in same change
4. risk note and rollback note included

## Branch and Scope Rules

- keep one logical change per PR
- avoid mixed feature + refactor + schema bundles
- escalate risky auth/public changes for manager review

## Extension Workflow

WhatsApp:

```bash
cd /whatsapp-extension-react
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```

LinkShot:

```bash
cd /linkshot-extension
pnpm build
```
