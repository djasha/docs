Use this page for fast triage. Use `Operations > Known Problems Catalog` for the complete categorized issue registry.

## 1) Local Startup

Symptoms:

- app/server fails to start
- unexpected auth or DB connection errors

Checks:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm dev:server
```

Actions:

1. verify `.env` and Supabase/DB credentials
2. confirm ports are not already in use
3. run API health check: `curl -s http://localhost:3333/api/health`

## 2) Test/CI Failures

Symptoms:

- unit/integration/e2e failures
- noisy warnings that hide real errors

Checks:

```bash
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:e2e
```

Actions:

1. run smallest failing suite first
2. validate schema/enum drift in touched routes
3. fix warning debt when it blocks clear triage

## 3) Extension Issues

Symptoms:

- extension cannot call API
- auth sync appears broken

Checks:

```bash
rg -n "WHATSAPP_EXTENSION_ORIGIN|LINKSHOT_EXTENSION_ORIGIN" server/index.ts
```

Actions:

1. rebuild extension after auth/API changes
2. verify extension origins are allowed by backend
3. verify tokens are synced and sent in API calls

## 4) Docs Deployment Issues

Symptoms:

- docs site shows stale or starter content
- pages missing from navigation

Checks:

```bash
pnpm docs:check
curl -sL https://docs.drdj.me | rg -n "DealDash Docs|Mint Starter Kit"
```

Actions:

1. verify Mintlify source repo/path settings
2. verify `docs.json` is committed to docs repo root
3. confirm DNS CNAME: `docs -> cname.mintlify-dns.com`

## 5) Security/Auth Regressions

Symptoms:

- unauthorized data visible
- session checks bypassed unexpectedly

Actions:

1. stop deployment/merge until verified
2. inspect auth/public/share route changes first
3. run targeted auth integration/e2e tests
4. document rollback path before retry

## Escalation Rule

If issue touches auth, sharing, external/public routes, or data integrity, escalate to manager agent review before merge.
