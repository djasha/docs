description: "Deployment configuration review for Render reliability and operability."

## Review Scope

- reproducible builds
- health check coverage
- environment variable safety
- runtime compatibility

## Current Render Hardening

`render.yaml` now includes:

- frozen lockfile install in build command
- explicit health check path: `/api/health`
- generated secrets for JWT/session in Render

## Checklist

- build uses deterministic dependency install
- app exposes reliable health endpoint
- no secrets committed in repository
- production origin and short-link domain configured correctly

## Suggested Operational Verification

1. deploy latest commit
2. verify health endpoint in Render dashboard
3. verify short-link redirects and auth-protected routes
4. verify background jobs start without runtime errors
