description: "How to manage docs in a dedicated GitHub repository and keep Mintlify in sync."
---

DealDash uses a separate docs repository: `https://github.com/djasha/docs`.

## Recommended Model

- author docs from DealDash source folder: `/mintlify-docs`
- sync content to `djasha/docs`
- Mintlify project should point to `djasha/docs` as production content source

## One-Time Setup

1. ensure Mintlify project is linked to `djasha/docs`
2. set custom domain in Mintlify: `docs.drdj.me`
3. keep DNS CNAME: `docs -> cname.mintlify-dns.com`

## Sync Command

Use the helper script from DealDash repo:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-docs-repo.sh /absolute/path/to/local/docs-clone
```

Then review and push from that docs clone.

## CI/CD Sync Option

You can automate sync with GitHub Actions using a PAT secret (`DOCS_REPO_PAT`) scoped to repo write on `djasha/docs`.

## Safety Rules

- run `pnpm docs:check` before sync
- review diff in docs repo before push
- never force-push docs history
- include clear commit messages for docs changes
