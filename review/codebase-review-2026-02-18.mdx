description: "Full-repo review summary focused on AI-agent readiness, safety, and reliability."

## Scope

Repository-wide review of architecture clarity, operational safety, testing baseline, dependency posture, and docs quality for autonomous agent usage.

## Validation Snapshot

- `pnpm check`: pass
- `pnpm test:unit`: pass
- `pnpm test:integration`: pass
- `pnpm test:e2e`: pass
- `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`: pass
- `pnpm docs:check`: pass

## Findings

1. Dependency security debt was addressed via version/override hardening.
2. Documentation drift existed across onboarding and architecture references.
3. AI schema endpoint (`/api/ai/*`) can drift from runtime contracts if not maintained alongside route/schema changes.
4. High `any` density in backend paths increases risk for autonomous edits.
5. CI warning noise (non-failing) still reduces signal quality.

## Recommendations

- maintain docs-first merge gates
- keep API/AI schema docs synchronized with route behavior
- reduce `any` usage in high-risk route files incrementally
- preserve `docs:check` and security audit in CI
