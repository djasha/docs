title: "Internal Docs Overview"
description: "How DealDash internal documentation is organized for developers and autonomous agents."
---

This section is the internal operating handbook for AI agents and developers.

## Goals

- fast onboarding for new agents
- predictable change safety gates
- consistent documentation updates as the code evolves
- explicit ownership for manager/support agent workflows

## Internal Documentation Structure

- `internal/overview`: start here
- `internal/manager-support-model`: role contract and merge gates
- `internal/change-protocol`: mandatory preflight, during-change, and postflight checklist
- `internal/docs-maintenance`: how to keep docs current without drift
- `internal/skill-blueprint`: reusable skill template for DealDash-specific agent behavior

## Canonical Sources Inside DealDash Repo

- `/AGENTS.md`

## Done Definition For Every Engineering Task

1. behavior change implemented safely
2. relevant checks pass
3. docs are updated in the same change
4. residual risk is written down
