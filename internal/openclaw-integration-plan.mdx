title: "OpenClaw Integration Plan"
description: "Phased integration model for OpenClaw manager/support agents in DealDash."
---

## Goal

Enable OpenClaw-driven execution without compromising safety, reliability, or documentation quality.

## Role Model

- `Manager agent`: planning, routing, merge gating, risk ownership
- `Support agent`: implementation, testing, docs updates, handoff

## Phased Rollout

1. Foundation
   - standardize runbooks and docs contracts
   - enforce required checks (`pnpm check`, tests, docs)
2. Controlled execution
   - manager-approved task routing only
   - evidence-based handoff format required
3. AI feature expansion
   - template enhancement and analysis workflows through explicit API contracts
   - audit trail for agent-originated writes
4. Continuous governance
   - weekly health review for code, CI, docs, security posture

## Non-Negotiable Gates

- no merge without docs updates for behavior changes
- no merge on auth/public/share changes without tests
- residual risk and rollback note required

## Target Outcomes

- faster safe delivery
- fewer regressions in high-risk paths
- consistent onboarding for new human and AI contributors
