title: "Collaboration Routes"
description: "Teams, users, shares, and external sharing pathways."
---

Collaboration behavior spans:

- `/server/routes/teams.ts`
- `/server/routes/users.ts`
- `/server/routes/shares.ts`
- `/server/routes/external-shares.ts`

## Responsibilities

- team-level access controls
- user assignment and visibility boundaries
- internal and external share lifecycle
- permission checks for shared resources

## Security Model Notes

- collaboration routes are high sensitivity
- share tokens/IDs must not leak private metadata
- role checks should be explicit and test-backed

## Required Validation

- integration tests for permission boundaries
- negative tests for unauthorized access
- verification of external share expiration/revocation behavior
- docs update when permission or sharing semantics change
