title: "LinkShot Extension"
description: "Manifest V3 extension for screenshot capture, OCR, and share/link workflows."
---

Implementation root: `/linkshot-extension`.

## Responsibilities

- capture and annotate screenshots
- optional OCR/offscreen processing
- create and manage shareable links through backend APIs

## High-Risk Areas

- offscreen/document permissions
- clipboard/file handling security
- auth synchronization with DealDash backend

## Change Workflow

```bash
cd /linkshot-extension
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Validation

- screenshot capture works on supported pages
- OCR behavior is deterministic and does not leak data
- generated links resolve correctly through `/r/*`
- permission scope is justified and reviewed
