## Documentation Rule

Any behavior/API/workflow change must include docs updates in the same PR.

## Source of Truth

- codebase docs for internal engineering context: `/docs/*`
- Mintlify publishable docs: `/mintlify-docs/*`

If they diverge, treat as a bug and fix immediately.

## Validation Commands

```bash
pnpm docs:check
pnpm check
```

Use targeted tests based on the changed area.

## Review Checklist

- nav entry exists for each new page
- links resolve
- examples match current behavior
- environment variables and setup steps are current
- high-risk path notes are still accurate

## Versioning and Audit Pages

Maintain dated review pages under `mintlify-docs/review/` and `docs/review/`.

Recommended cadence:

- lightweight docs pass: weekly
- full architecture and risk review: monthly

## Ownership

- manager agent owns quality gate and merge criteria
- support agent owns implementation-level doc updates
- both are accountable for docs accuracy
