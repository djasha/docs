description: "Point docs.drdj.me to Mintlify and verify production routing."

## Target

Serve DealDash docs from `https://docs.drdj.me`.

## DNS record required

Create a **CNAME** record:

- Name/Host: `docs`
- Target/Value: `cname.mintlify-dns.com`
- TTL: Auto (or 300)

## Important

- Remove any conflicting `A`/`AAAA` records for `docs.drdj.me`.
- Keep only one DNS answer path for this host.

## Mintlify side

1. Open project settings in Mintlify.
2. Add custom domain `docs.drdj.me`.
3. Wait for verification and certificate issuance.

## Verification

```bash
dig +short CNAME docs.drdj.me
curl -I https://docs.drdj.me
```

Expected:

- CNAME resolves to `cname.mintlify-dns.com`
- HTTPS returns 200/301 with valid TLS cert

## Canonical URL

This repo sets canonical metadata to `https://docs.drdj.me` in `/mintlify-docs/docs.json`.
