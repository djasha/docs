description: "Policy for keeping docs reliable, current, and automation-friendly."

## Source of Truth Model

- behavior truth: code
- internal engineering docs: `/docs`
- published docs: `/mintlify-docs` -> `djasha/docs`

## Required Update Triggers

Update docs in same PR when changing:

- API endpoints or schemas
- auth/session/public route behavior
- extension permissions/workflows
- deployment or runbook steps

## Quality Gates

```bash
pnpm docs:check
```

And for behavior changes:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Plus relevant tests.

## Ownership

- manager agent: architecture/operations quality gate
- support agent: implementation-level docs updates
- both: prevent docs drift
