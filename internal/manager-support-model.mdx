## Roles

`Manager agent`

- turns product requests into scoped technical tasks
- enforces quality and safety gates before merge
- tracks risk and follow-up debt

`Support agent`

- implements scoped tasks
- runs checks
- updates docs in the same task

## Manager Merge Gate

Every merge request should include:

- changed files list
- command evidence with pass/fail
- test evidence relevant to touched paths
- risk statement and rollback note

Block merge when:

- auth/security changes have no tests
- docs are stale or contradictory
- safety checks are skipped without rationale

## Support Agent Contract

For each task:

1. restate scope in one short paragraph
2. implement smallest safe change
3. run required checks
4. update docs
5. hand back summary + risks

## Routing Rule

Use `internal/change-protocol` and `agents/task-routing` together to assign ownership and validation depth.
