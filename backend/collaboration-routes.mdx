## Team routes

Source: `/server/routes/teams.ts`

- team CRUD
- invitations and membership
- shared entities
- team messages, tasks, activity, whiteboards

## Share routes

- `/server/routes/shares.ts`
- `/server/routes/external-shares.ts`

## Risk profile

These routes are permission-sensitive. Every change must include auth/permission tests.
