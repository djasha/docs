title: "Deals Routes"
description: "Deals CRUD, progress tracking, and bulk workflow route family."
---

Primary implementation: `/server/routes/deals.ts`.

## Route Capabilities

- CRUD endpoints for deal records
- bulk update/delete/import operations
- related deal analytics and helper lookups
- deal-progress children (videos, stories, views, payments)

## Typical Dependencies

- influencer/contact joins
- tasks/reminders triggered from deal state changes
- activity logging and analytics endpoints

## Testing Expectations

When deals routes change:

1. run deal-focused integration tests
2. test at least one end-to-end deal lifecycle path
3. verify filtering/sorting/pagination behavior
4. confirm schema and status values remain consistent

## Common Risk Areas

- enum/status drift between DB, frontend, and AI schema endpoint
- partial updates overwriting nullable fields incorrectly
- bulk endpoints skipping validation or auth checks
