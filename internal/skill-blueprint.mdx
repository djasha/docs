title: "DealDash Skill Blueprint"
description: "Portable skill template for consistent AI behavior in DealDash tasks."
---

Use this as the base when creating a reusable DealDash skill.

## Canonical Draft

See `/docs/agents/DEALDASH_AGENT_SKILL.md`.

## Required Workflow In Skill

1. read `/AGENTS.md`
2. read change safety protocol
3. run baseline checks
4. implement scoped change
5. update docs (`/docs` and `/mintlify-docs`)
6. run verification checks

## Recommended Skill Guardrails

- call out high-risk paths explicitly
- require evidence-based handoff
- enforce typed/validated boundaries for input data
- require rollback note for risky changes

## Why This Matters

A stable skill definition makes multi-agent execution predictable, reduces regressions, and keeps documentation quality from decaying over time.
